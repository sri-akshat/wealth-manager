## 1\. High-Level Architecture

Figure: High-level system architecture – The investor platform initially follows a Python monolith design, where all backend components reside in a single codebase (monolith) but organized into cleanly separated modules. This modular-monolith approach keeps the code unified while enforcing clear boundaries between domains (e.g. user management, portfolio, transactions)​

[breadcrumbscollector.tech](https://breadcrumbscollector.tech/modular-monolith-in-python/#:~:text=Modular%20monolith%20)

. Such an architecture is simple to develop and deploy for a small team, enabling fast iteration and reducing initial complexity​

[blog.bytebytego.com](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/from-monolith-to-microservices-key#:~:text=Monolithic%20architecture%20is%20a%20software,to%20develop%20and%20deploy%20software)

. Over time, each module can evolve into an independent microservice if needed, without a complete rewrite, because the monolith’s components are designed to be autonomous and communicate via internal APIs (analogous to microservice principles)​

[breadcrumbscollector.tech](https://breadcrumbscollector.tech/modular-monolith-in-python/#:~:text=%2A%20autonomy%20%2A%20loosely,no%20direct%20access%20to%20database)

.

In the current design, client apps (Investor mobile app, Web app, Admin dashboard, Distributor portal) connect to the backend via a unified API layer. As the platform grows, an API Gateway can be introduced as the single entry point for all clients. The API Gateway would route requests to internal services (or modules) and handle cross-cutting concerns (authentication, rate limiting, etc.)​

[microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#:~:text=Implement%20an%20API%20gateway%20that,fanning%20out%20to%20multiple%20services)

. This pattern insulates clients from how the backend is partitioned – for example, whether it’s one monolith or multiple microservices – and it reduces chattiness by aggregating data, which is especially beneficial for mobile clients with higher latency​

[microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#:~:text=Using%20an%20API%20gateway%20has,the%20following%20benefits)

​

[microservices.io](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#:~:text=enables%20clients%20to%20retrieve%20data,the%20client%20to%20API%20gateway)

. In a future microservices architecture, the API Gateway would facilitate communication between services and enable independent scaling of hot spots (e.g. a transaction service could scale without affecting others).

App Architecture Choices (Native vs Hybrid): For the investor mobile app (iOS and Android), we consider whether to build native apps (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) or use a cross-platform framework (Flutter or React Native). A native approach offers fine-grained control and potentially the best performance, but it doubles the development effort and maintenance. Given the need to deliver the MVP in ~3-6 months and maintain a white-labeled solution, a cross-platform architecture is recommended. Modern frameworks like Flutter and React Native deliver near-native performance by rendering directly to native UI or canvas. For example, Flutter avoids the JavaScript bridge overhead by using the Skia engine for UI, whereas React Native relies on a JS bridge which can introduce latency​

[blog.flutter.wtf](https://blog.flutter.wtf/flutter-vs-react-native/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20performance%2C,cause%20a%20slowdown%20in%20performance)

. In practice, Flutter apps achieve performance comparable to native and have a unified codebase, accelerating development and ensuring consistency across iOS/Android. We will elaborate on the chosen approach in the next section, but at the architecture level, a cross-platform app will interact with the backend via REST/JSON APIs (or GraphQL) just like a native app, with no changes to server architecture.

## 2\. App Development Approach

Cross-Platform Framework vs Native: We recommend Flutter for developing the iOS and Android investor apps. Using Flutter allows a single codebase for both platforms, speeding up development and simplifying future white-label customizations. Flutter’s widget framework provides a native-like UI experience on both iOS and Android, and its architecture bypasses the need for a JavaScript bridge, yielding high performance even for complex, data-heavy screens​

[blog.flutter.wtf](https://blog.flutter.wtf/flutter-vs-react-native/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20performance%2C,cause%20a%20slowdown%20in%20performance)

. This is important for an investor app that may display rich analytics and real-time data streams. React Native is an alternative cross-platform option; it has a large ecosystem, but it may face slight performance lags for very large portfolios due to the JS bridge and might require more native code for certain features. Native (Swift/Kotlin) development would provide excellent performance but at the cost of duplicated effort and a longer timeline. Given the MVP timeline, Flutter offers the best balance of speed and performance. However, we will keep the architecture flexible so that specific native modules can be integrated if needed (for example, using platform channels in Flutter to call native code for something like advanced biometrics or background services).

Offline Support & Caching: The investor app should implement an offline-first strategy to remain useful even with poor connectivity. This means the app will cache critical data (e.g. the user’s portfolio, recent transactions, market data) locally using a secure database (such as SQLite or Hive for Flutter). On launch or when navigating to a section, the app will show the last known data immediately from the local cache, so the user isn’t stuck waiting for a network call​

[developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer/offline-first#:~:text=,when%20charging%20or%20on%20WiFi)

. In the background, the app will attempt to sync updates from the backend – for example, fetching new transactions or price updates. We will use a combination of on-demand sync (when the user explicitly refreshes or performs an action) and periodic background sync (e.g. pulling critical updates daily or when the app resumes). This caching strategy not only improves perceived performance but also reduces unnecessary API calls. We will design cache invalidation carefully: data that rarely changes (e.g. fund static information) can be cached longer, whereas transaction statuses might be refreshed more frequently. If the network is unavailable, the app will queue any user actions (like a buy/sell order) and submit them when connectivity is restored, providing appropriate user feedback. By remaining usable without a constant network and fetching updates opportunistically (e.g. only when on Wi-Fi or charging for large syncs), the app will offer a seamless experience even in low-connectivity scenarios​

[developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer/offline-first#:~:text=,when%20charging%20or%20on%20WiFi)

.

Secure Authentication & Authorization: Security is paramount since this is a financial application. We will employ OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE for authenticating users on the mobile app. This is the industry best-practice for native/mobile apps – the app will use a system web view for the user to enter credentials (or OTP, etc.), then receive an auth code which is exchanged for JWT tokens (access and refresh)​

[developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#:~:text=About%20the%20Authorization%20Code%20grant,with%20PKCE)

. Using OAuth PKCE ensures the app never directly handles the user’s password and mitigates interception risks. The backend will serve as the OAuth server or integrate with a secure identity provider to issue JWTs. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for stateless authentication on API calls – the mobile app will include the JWT in headers for each request, and the backend will verify and authorize accordingly. JWTs will be short-lived access tokens for security, with longer-lived refresh tokens to get new access tokens when needed.

For additional security and convenience, the app will support biometric authentication (fingerprint/FaceID). After the first login, the user can enable biometrics for subsequent logins. The implementation will store the refresh token (or an encryption key for it) in the device’s secure storage (Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android). On app reopen, the user can use biometrics to unlock this key, decrypt the refresh token, and obtain a new access token silently​

[security.stackexchange.com](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/270911/re-authentication-with-biometrics-in-a-mobile-app-using-access-token#:~:text=My%20first%20thought%20would%20be,would%20support%20that%20flow%20though)

. This way, the biometric unlock is tied to retrieving tokens – no biometric data ever leaves the device, and the backend sees only standard OAuth tokens. We will ensure that if the user fully logs out or if the refresh token expires, they must reauthenticate (biometric will not bypass an actual session expiry, it’s just a local convenience). All API communication will occur over HTTPS with modern TLS to protect data in transit. Additionally, we’ll consider device attestation and JWT claim checks (like audience, issuer, expirations) on the backend for each call to thwart token misuse.

## 3\. API & Data Flow Design

Integration with BSE StAR MF and MFU: The platform will integrate with external mutual fund transaction systems – primarily BSE StAR MF and MF Utilities (MFU) – to execute buy/sell orders and other transactions. We will abstract these via a Transaction Gateway Service in our backend. Initially, we might choose one (say BSE StAR MF) as the primary execution route for simplicity, but design the module to switch or load-balance between BSE and MFU if needed (for example, if one provides better coverage for certain funds or as a fallback if the other is down). The BSE StAR MF API is offered as a SOAP-based web service​

[bsestarmf.in](https://www.bsestarmf.in/APIFileStructure.pdf#:~:text=Web%20Services%20APIs%20The%20WEB,2%20libraries)

(with XML messages), so our Python backend will use a SOAP client (or REST wrapper if provided) to submit orders, cancellations, fetch order status, etc. BSE provides a test environment for development​

[bsestarmf.in](https://www.bsestarmf.in/APIFileStructure.pdf#:~:text=BSE%20Provides%20a%20Test%20Environment,BSE%20StAR%20MF%20Member%20ID)

, which we will use during implementation. MFU similarly offers an API or file-based interface for transactions – since MFU is an industry utility that connects to RTAs, it can handle orders across all AMCs. We will likely implement MFU integration using their REST/SOAP APIs (if available) or even file exchange if required. The design will encapsulate BSE/MFU specifics behind a uniform interface in our system: e.g., a TransactionService class with methods like placeOrder(orderDetails) will internally call BSE or MFU API and handle the response. This keeps the core application logic decoupled from the particular external API. Key considerations will be authentication (each platform will require credentials/certificates for our system), message format conversion (our internal JSON -> external SOAP XML or vice versa), and error handling (translating API errors into user-friendly messages).

Integration with CAMS and Karvy (KFintech) APIs: To provide a comprehensive view of the investor’s portfolio, we need to retrieve data from registrar agencies CAMS and KFintech (formerly Karvy), which maintain records of mutual fund holdings. Our data flow strategy will use two approaches:

1.  Real-time updates via transactions: All orders placed through our platform (via BSE/MFU) will be recorded in our database. We will capture confirmations (order executed, units allotted, etc.) from these APIs in real-time. However, investors may have outside holdings or historical data that needs to be imported.

2.  Periodic portfolio sync: We will integrate with CAMS/KFintech to fetch portfolio holdings and transactions. If direct APIs are available (for example, CAMS provides an API for fetching investor holdings given PAN or Folio), we will use those. In absence of direct public APIs, a common industry practice is to use Consolidated Account Statements (CAS). We can programmatically request or parse the CAS (which is a PDF containing all MF holdings for an investor across CAMS and KFin) and convert that to data. For instance, tools/APIs exist to parse CAS PDFs to JSON​  
    [casparser.in  
    ](https://casparser.in/#:~:text=CAS%20Parser%20is%20an%20API,KFintech%2C%20CDSL%20and%20NSDL)– our system could either use such a service or implement a parser to update the portfolio. The platform will likely incorporate a service where, given an investor’s PAN and a one-time consent (or CAS PDF upload), we import all existing holdings into the app.


In practice, we might start by requiring the investor to upload their CAMS/KFintech CAS PDF in the app; our backend will parse it and populate the portfolio. Going forward, MF Central (a new initiative by CAMS & KFin) could provide an API for fetching consolidated data – we will keep an eye on that for integration once mature. All data from external sources (BSE, MFU, CAMS, KFin) will be normalized into our system’s data model. For example, different APIs might use different scheme codes or identifiers – we’ll maintain mapping tables to unify them. We’ll also store reference data like fund names, NAVs, etc., possibly fetched from a third-party feed or the AMCs, to enrich the data shown to users.

Transaction Processing & Reconciliation: When a user places an order (purchase, redemption, SIP setup, etc.) on the app, the flow will be:

1.  The mobile app calls our backend API (e.g. /transactions) with the order details.

2.  The backend (Transaction module) validates the request (checks KYC status, available balance for redemption, etc.), then calls the BSE or MFU API to place the order in real-time.

3.  The external API returns an immediate response (like an order ID or success/fail status). Our backend will log this and also create an internal transaction record marked as “Pending” or “Processing”.

4.  The user gets an immediate confirmation in the app (e.g. “Order placed, reference ID 12345”), and the status is visible as pending.


Reconciliation comes into play after this. The actual settlement of a mutual fund order may happen later (end of day for purchase, T+1 for confirmation, etc.). We need to ensure our system’s record eventually matches the RTA’s records. We will implement a transaction status poller or callback handler:

*   For BSE StAR MF, we can periodically call their order status API or receive their end-of-day confirmation files, to update whether each order succeeded, failed, units allotted, etc.. Similarly for MFU, which might provide transaction status reports or feed.

*   At the end of each trading day, we will reconcile all transactions. This can involve comparing our internal transaction ledger with an RTA transaction report. If any discrepancy is found (e.g. an order we marked as pending didn’t go through or vice versa), the system will flag it for manual review and correction.

*   We’ll also update holdings based on executed transactions. For example, if a purchase of 10 units completed, our portfolio data for that investor should increment by 10 units for the respective fund.


Additionally, CAMS/KFintech reconciliation will be done perhaps via a daily CAS or transaction feed. For instance, we might receive a transaction confirmation from CAMS for all orders executed for our clients (since we are a distributor, RTAs can provide daily reports). This serves as a source of truth to update any missing or incorrect statuses in our system. The reconciliation logic will mark transactions as completed and update the portfolio holdings accordingly, ensuring that what we display to the user (via the app) matches the official records.

Data Synchronization Strategy: We will employ a hybrid sync model:

*   On-Demand Sync: Certain actions trigger immediate data fetches. For example, when the user opens the app or pulls to refresh their portfolio, the app will call an endpoint to fetch the latest portfolio and transaction data. The backend can in turn fetch fresh data from external APIs if needed (e.g., check for any new transactions for that user via CAMS API) or rely on its latest cached data (if it’s in sync). On-demand sync ensures the user can get the latest info when they need it.

*   Scheduled Sync: In the background, the backend will have scheduled jobs (cron tasks) for regular data updates. For instance, every night, a job could fetch the latest valuations (NAVs) for all funds and update the database so that performance calculations are up-to-date. Another daily job might retrieve any new transactions or holdings changes from CAMS/KFin for all users (perhaps by processing overnight reports or fetching CAS data for users who logged in that day). We may schedule a refresh of each user’s portfolio data daily or weekly depending on API limits and staleness tolerance.

*   Real-Time Updates: Where possible, we will move toward real-time data streams. For example, if the BSE/MFU API supports webhooks or push notifications on certain events (like order status change), we will subscribe to those and immediately update the relevant user’s data in our system. Similarly, if we can open a streaming feed for market data (NAV updates or indices) or use sockets, we might push real-time updates to the app (for now, likely not in MVP except maybe to show live market indices on dashboard). Real-time transaction status updates will improve user experience (they can see an order go from pending to completed without manual refresh).

*   Conflict Resolution: In case of concurrent updates (e.g., the user makes an offline transaction directly with a fund house and our scheduled sync brings that data in), our system should be able to merge the data. We plan to treat external data (from CAMS/KFin) as source of truth for holdings – if it shows a new folio or transaction we didn’t know of, we add it. If our internal transaction shows completed but RTA shows failed, we’ll reconcile by marking it failed and notifying the user accordingly.


Throughout these flows, data integrity and consistency is key. All writes (transactions, updates) will be done within transactions on our database to ensure consistency (e.g., an order insertion and a portfolio update happen atomically if part of the same flow). We will also maintain an audit log of all data fetched from external APIs and how we processed it, which aids in debugging any discrepancies.

## 4\. Performance & Scalability Planning

Handling Large Portfolios & Transaction Volumes: Some users (especially institutional or HNI clients) might have very large portfolios (hundreds of folios, thousands of transactions). The system must be optimized to handle this efficiently:

*   On the database side, we will ensure proper indexing on key fields like user ID, folio numbers, fund codes, etc., so that queries to fetch a user’s portfolio or transactions are fast. We will use pagination for transaction history – the app can load, say, 20 transactions at a time and allow the user to scroll for more, rather than trying to fetch thousands of records in one go.

*   We will implement lazy loading on the app for certain data-heavy sections (e.g., only load detailed analytics when the user navigates there, not all upfront). Summaries and totals can be precomputed (for example, store the latest portfolio valuation in a separate table) to avoid recalculating from scratch on each request.

*   For computationally intensive tasks (like calculating IRR or XIRR for a long transaction history, or generating complex reports), we might offload those to background jobs or cache the results. The app can request a report, and the backend generates it asynchronously if it’s heavy, then returns it (or notifies when ready).

*   Batch processing: If multiple expensive operations can be combined, we will do so. For instance, if retrieving data for 100 funds from an external API, batch the requests if the API allows (like a single request for multiple fund data instead of 100 separate calls).

*   The Python monolith will be designed with efficient algorithms and use vectorized operations or compiled libraries where possible (e.g., use NumPy/Pandas for heavy calculations, or delegate to the database for set-based operations rather than Python loops).


Caching Strategy: Caching will play a major role in performance. We will employ caching at multiple levels:

*   Backend response caching: For endpoints that are expensive and relatively static, we can cache the results in memory or a fast store like Redis. For example, the list of mutual fund schemes or a static lookup of scheme categories can be cached for hours. If many users request the same data (like top funds list), the cache will serve subsequent requests quickly without hitting the DB or external API repeatedly.

*   Data caching: Within the backend, when calling external APIs (like fetching NAV values or checking order status), we will cache those results if appropriate. For instance, NAV for a fund is updated once a day – our system can cache the NAV values so that all user requests use the cached value instead of each making an external call. This reduces load on external services and speeds up responses​  
    [testfully.io  
    ](https://testfully.io/blog/api-rate-limit/#:~:text=,any%20one%20server%2C%20distribute%20incoming).

*   App caching: As discussed, the app itself caches data locally, which reduces the frequency of network calls. If a piece of data hasn’t changed, the backend might even tell the app via response headers or a version token that the data is unchanged, so the app can continue using its cache without fetching again.

*   We will be careful to invalidate caches appropriately. For example, when a user makes a new transaction, their cached portfolio value should be considered stale and updated after the transaction completes. We might use a pub-sub mechanism or cache-busting tokens to coordinate this.


API Rate Limiting: To ensure stability, the platform will enforce rate limiting on API usage. This includes:

*   Client-side rate limiting: The API gateway or backend will limit how many requests a single user or IP can make in a given time frame (for example, to prevent abuse or a buggy app from spamming requests). We might allow, say, X requests per minute per token, and respond with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests if exceeded.

*   External API throttling: We will also throttle our calls to external services (BSE, MFU, etc.) to respect their rate limits. For instance, if BSE allows 100 calls/minute, our integration layer will queue calls or use a token-bucket algorithm to ensure we do not exceed that. This prevents getting blocked by third parties and ensures our burst traffic doesn’t break their limits.

*   Using the API Gateway, we can configure global and key-based limits. For example, a certain expensive endpoint might have a lower rate limit to protect the backend. We will also implement exponential backoff retry strategies for external calls to handle transient failures without overwhelming the services.


Caching and rate limiting together will greatly improve throughput – caching reduces the load and frequency of hitting heavy endpoints, thereby also reducing the chance of hitting rate limits​

[testfully.io](https://testfully.io/blog/api-rate-limit/#:~:text=5,to%20cached%20data%20or%20providing)

. We will monitor cache hit rates and tune accordingly.

Load Balancing & Horizontal Scaling: The backend monolith will be stateless (as much as possible) so that we can run multiple instances behind a load balancer. The API gateway (or a simple Nginx/HAProxy) will distribute incoming requests across multiple backend server instances​

[testfully.io](https://testfully.io/blog/api-rate-limit/#:~:text=,any%20one%20server%2C%20distribute%20incoming)

. This provides horizontal scalability: as user load grows, we can spin up more instances of the Python app. We will containerize the application (e.g., using Docker) to deploy on a cluster or cloud service, making scaling up or down easier.

For the database, initial deployment may use a single primary DB server. To scale reads, we will introduce read replicas – copies of the database that can handle read-only queries​

[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/scaling-your-amazon-rds-instance-vertically-and-horizontally/#:~:text=To%20scale%20your%20read%20operations%2C,have%20the%20read%20replica%20feature)

. Our code can direct heavy read operations (like fetching large portfolios or analytics queries) to a replica, easing load on the primary. This way, if we have many users checking their portfolios simultaneously, those requests can be served by replicas. As writes increase (e.g., if transaction volume grows), we can consider sharding by user or splitting certain tables, but that likely won’t be needed until we have very high scale. We will also ensure the database can be vertically scaled (moved to a larger instance with more CPU/RAM) as a first easy step if performance lags.

Scaling the Monolith to Microservices: While not needed at MVP, we keep an eye on future scalability. If certain components become bottlenecks or need independent scaling, we will peel them off into microservices. For example, a separate service for handling real-time market data or a dedicated portfolio calculation service. These would then register with the API gateway. The gateway and inter-service communication would be secured (using internal APIs or a message bus for events). By designing with modularity in mind now, the transition later will be smoother. We also use cloud-managed services where possible (for instance, using a managed cache like AWS ElastiCache for Redis, or a managed database with read replicas) to gain scalability and reliability out-of-the-box.

High Availability: To ensure uptime, especially as a financial app, we plan for redundancy. Multiple app instances across different availability zones (if cloud) behind the load balancer means one server failure doesn’t take down the service. The database will have standby/failover setup (like a replica that can be promoted or using a cluster). We will also use health checks – the load balancer will periodically check each instance, and if one is unresponsive, it will stop sending traffic to it. In case of a surge (say a viral growth or a market event causing many logins), auto-scaling rules can add more instances when CPU or queue times go beyond a threshold.

Finally, performance testing will be part of our process. We’ll use stress tests on the API to find the breaking points and optimize accordingly (for example, adjust Gunicorn worker processes for Python, tune DB connection pool sizes, etc.). By implementing caching, efficient queries, and horizontal scaling, the system will be able to handle large portfolios and high transaction volumes gracefully.

## 5\. Quality & Maintenance Strategy

CI/CD Pipeline & Automated Testing: We will establish a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deployment of both the backend and the mobile apps. All code changes will go through continuous integration – e.g., using GitHub Actions or Jenkins – which will run our test suite on each commit. Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) is critical to catch regressions early and ensure that new features don’t break existing functionality​

[headspin.io](https://www.headspin.io/blog/why-you-should-consider-ci-cd-pipeline-automation-testing#:~:text=Its%20primary%20goal%20is%20to,may%20be%20delivered%20more%20quickly)

​

[testlio.com](https://testlio.com/blog/ci-cd-test-automation/#:~:text=CI%2FCD%20%26%20The%20Need%20For,impact%20of%20the%20committed%20changes)

. For the Python backend, we’ll write unit tests for each module (e.g., tests for the transaction processing logic, tests for API endpoints using a framework like pytest + Flask/FastAPI testing client). We’ll also include integration tests that simulate end-to-end flows (for instance, a test that places a sample order and mocks the BSE API response to verify our workflow). If possible, critical external integrations can be tested against sandbox environments (BSE’s test environment) as part of a nightly build.

On the mobile side, we will have a mix of unit tests (for any logic in the Flutter app) and UI tests using Flutter’s testing framework to validate that screens render properly with given data. We may also set up device farm tests for basic flows to ensure the app works on a range of devices (especially important for Android variety).

The CI pipeline will ensure that if tests fail, the code is not merged/deployed. Once changes pass tests and are merged to main, the CD (Continuous Deployment) can take over: we might start with a staging environment where the new backend build is deployed for further manual testing or UAT. For mobile, we would distribute internal builds via TestFlight (iOS) and internal testing tracks (Android) on each merge to allow rapid iteration.

When ready for release, the pipeline can automate much of the deployment:

*   Backend Deployment: We plan to containerize the backend. The pipeline can build a Docker image on each release, run final tests, and then deploy the container to our hosting environment (e.g., AWS ECS/EKS, Azure, or even a VM cluster). Deployment will likely use a blue-green or rolling deployment strategy to avoid downtime. In a blue-green setup, we’d deploy the new version to a parallel environment (Green) while the old (Blue) is still live, then switch traffic once healthy. This makes rollbacks nearly instantaneous by switching back​  
    [docs.inedo.com  
    ](https://docs.inedo.com/docs/buildmaster-ci-cd-deployment-patterns-blue-green#:~:text=Blue,production%20environments%3A%20Blue%20and%20Green). We will also version our API; if we ever introduce non-backward compatible changes, we’ll handle versioning to not break older app versions.

*   Mobile App Release: While not continuous to users (since app updates go through stores), we will streamline the release process. The pipeline can prepare the signed app binaries (IPA/APK or AAB) and perhaps even trigger store submissions (using fastlane or CI tasks) when we choose to release. We’ll use feature flag toggles to hide unfinished features, so we can deploy code that’s off in the UI and enable it later without another full release.


Monitoring & Logging: Once the system is live, we need continuous monitoring to quickly detect issues and understand system health:

*   We will implement centralized logging. All backend instances will ship their logs to a central log management system (like the ELK stack – Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana – or a cloud logging service). This includes application logs (important events, errors, warnings) and access logs (API request traces). By aggregating logs, we can search and analyze them in one place. For example, if an error “order placement failed” occurs, we can find all instances across servers, and correlate with user IDs or timestamps.

*   Error tracking: We will use a tool like Sentry for real-time error alerting. Sentry will capture exceptions in the backend (and even in the mobile app) along with context (stack traces, user info) and alert the dev team. This way, if a bug occurs in production, we know about it before users even report it, and we can track its frequency​  
    [sentry.io  
    ](https://sentry.io/for/mobile/#:~:text=Mobile%20Crash%20Reporting%20and%20App,versions%20as%20well%20as). The mobile app will have crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry’s mobile SDK) to log any app crashes or errors in the wild, so we can prioritize fixing them.

*   Performance monitoring: For backend, we’ll use Prometheus to collect metrics such as request throughput, latency of endpoints, CPU/memory usage, DB query performance, etc. Dashboards in Grafana will display these metrics and we can set up alerts (via PagerDuty or similar) if thresholds are crossed (e.g., API latency spikes or memory usage too high). Prometheus can also monitor infrastructure metrics (like DB server CPU, etc.)​  
    [coralogix.com  
    ](https://coralogix.com/guides/prometheus-monitoring/#:~:text=Alternatives%20coralogix,metrics%20is%20useful%20for). This helps in detecting performance bottlenecks early. For the mobile app, we might use Firebase Performance Monitoring to see network call performance and app startup times on user devices.

*   Uptime monitoring: We will have external monitors ping critical endpoints regularly (health check pings) to ensure the service is up. If downtime is detected, the team is alerted immediately to respond.


All these monitoring components ensure that we have full visibility into the system’s behavior in production, and can proactively maintain reliability.

Error Handling & Rollback Mechanisms: We will code the system defensively to handle errors gracefully. This means:

*   Within the backend, anticipate and catch exceptions at boundaries (for example, if an external API call fails or times out, we catch that and respond to the app with a clear error message or fallback, rather than crashing). Each service integration will have retry logic for transient failures (with backoff to avoid hammering a down service). If a certain component is down (say CAMS API not responding), the app might get a slightly stale data with a warning rather than an error – the system should degrade gracefully.

*   Transactions in the database will be used to maintain data consistency. If an operation consists of multiple steps and one fails in the middle, we will roll back the database transaction so we don’t end up with partial data committed.


On the deployment side, as mentioned, we will use strategies like blue-green deployments to allow instant rollback​

[docs.inedo.com](https://docs.inedo.com/docs/buildmaster-ci-cd-deployment-patterns-blue-green#:~:text=Blue,production%20environments%3A%20Blue%20and%20Green)

. If a new release is deployed and we notice issues (through monitoring or user reports), we can quickly revert to the last stable version. For mobile apps, rollback is trickier (since you can’t downgrade an app remotely easily), so we will be very careful with feature toggles and phased rollouts. We can do a staged rollout on the app stores (release to a small percentage of users, monitor crash rates, then increase gradually). If a serious issue is found, we can pull the update and users can continue using the old version while we fix and re-release.

Furthermore, we plan to incorporate feature flags (if possible, using a library or custom build config) so that risky features can be turned off server-side. For example, if we introduce a new type of transaction and it misbehaves, we can disable it via a config so it doesn’t show up or function in the app until fixed, avoiding a full rollback.

Regular backups of the database and a tested restore process are part of rollback preparedness on the data side. If somehow bad data gets in (though we’ll aim to prevent it), we can restore data or write migrations to correct it.

Finally, the team will practice incident response: having runbooks for common issues (e.g., what to do if BSE API is down – maybe queue transactions and notify users). This ensures maintenance of the system is smooth and issues are resolved with minimal user impact.

## 6\. Development Roadmap & Milestones

MVP Timeline (3–6 months): We plan the MVP development over approximately 6 months with clear milestones. The goal of the MVP is to support the core journey: user onboarding, viewing portfolio, and executing mutual fund transactions, along with basic analytics. Below is a high-level roadmap with phases:

Phase 1: Onboarding & Core Setup (Month 1-2):

*   Requirements: User registration (or invitation by distributor), KYC verification integration (possibly via PAN lookup or KRA), and secure login (with OAuth/JWT setup).

*   Deliverables: Implement the authentication service on backend, the mobile app login/signup screens, and integrate a basic user profile API. Also set up the project infrastructure (CI/CD pipeline, dev/staging environments, etc.) in this phase.

*   Milestone: By end of Month 2, a user can create an account or sign in, and see a blank dashboard (if no data yet) – essentially the skeleton is in place.


Phase 2: Transactions Module (Month 2-3):

*   Requirements: Integrate with BSE StAR MF (or MFU) for placing orders. Build UI for placing a mutual fund purchase, redemption, switch, and setting up SIP (systematic investment plans). Implement order tracking.

*   Deliverables: Backend can place a mutual fund order via the external API and store the result. The app has screens for selecting a fund, entering amount, and confirming the transaction. A basic order status page shows pending/completed orders.

*   Milestone: By end of Month 3, an investor user (test user) can successfully execute a mutual fund purchase through the app and see the confirmation. This demonstrates end-to-end transaction flow functioning.


Phase 3: Portfolio & Holdings (Month 3-4):

*   Requirements: Develop the portfolio view – aggregate all holdings of the user. This involves pulling initial data (perhaps via CAS upload or sample data) and displaying current value, gains, etc. Also include a feature to add external holdings (like upload CAS or link account).

*   Deliverables: Backend services to fetch and store portfolio holdings (initially maybe from a CAS file import feature). Calculations for current value and profit/loss. Mobile app screens showing the list of investments, their current amounts, and overall portfolio summary. Possibly a pie chart of allocation (if time permits).

*   Milestone: By end of Month 4, a user can see their mutual fund portfolio in the app – including details like fund name, units held, current NAV, and overall gain/loss. Basic caching of this data for offline is in place as well.


Phase 4: Analytics & Reports (Month 4-5):

*   Requirements: Provide value-added features like performance charts over time, goal tracking (if included), and family account view (the UI screenshots provided suggest features like “Wealth Fit” analytics, goal tracker, etc.). Also, create reports such as transaction history, capital gains report for tax, etc.

*   Deliverables: Backend endpoints that compute portfolio performance over time (maybe using historical NAVs), an analytics screen in the app showing trends (e.g., a graph of portfolio value), and a section for reports (e.g., view realized gains). We will also implement any remaining secondary features such as a fund search/browse tool or a news feed if those are part of the offering.

*   Milestone: By end of Month 5, the app provides insightful analytics: the user can see how their portfolio has grown, breakdown by asset or family members (if multi-user family support), and generate a basic report (like a PDF or screen for tax purposes).


Phase 5: Hardening and Beta (Month 5-6):

*   Requirements: Non-functional requirements are tackled here – load testing, security audit, UX refinements, and bug fixes. Also, set up monitoring dashboards and ensure the CI/CD and rollback processes are well-tested. Prepare for deployment to production and app stores.

*   Deliverables: A polished version of the app ready for pilot users. Documentation for users and administrators. Training the support team (if any) on how to use the admin dashboard (for distributors).

*   Milestone: Mid-month 6: Launch a beta with a select group of users (maybe the client’s own team or a friendly set of IFA customers) to gather feedback. End of Month 6: Public launch of MVP version 1.0.


Throughout these phases, we will maintain close feedback loops with stakeholders. Each phase’s end milestone will include a review/demo, and adjustments to scope will be made if needed (for instance, if transaction integration takes longer, we might push a less critical feature to after MVP).

Future Scaling – Multi-Asset Class Support: While the MVP focuses on mutual funds, the platform is envisioned as a multi-asset investment app (e.g., including equities, bonds, NPS, P2P loans, etc., as hinted by some menu items). To prepare for this, we are designing the system with a modular architecture by asset class. In the monolith, this means separate modules or packages for each asset type (one for Mutual Funds, another for Equities, etc.) with well-defined interfaces. For example, there could be a generic Portfolio interface that different asset modules implement. This way, adding a new asset class (say Stocks) would involve creating a new Stocks module (with its own models, APIs, integration to a stock broker) and plugging it into the existing interfaces (so that, for instance, the overall portfolio screen can now aggregate both mutual funds and stocks). The backend can evolve such that each asset class module can be carved out as a microservice when needed, each with its own database or integration points. Using a domain-driven design approach will help – each asset class is a bounded context with minimal coupling to others, which aligns with the modular monolith approach we established​

.

From a data perspective, we might use a single unified database with tables namespaced by asset (e.g., MF\_transactions, Stock\_transactions) initially, but as we scale, those could live in different databases optimized for each domain. The API design will also reflect this modularity – for instance, endpoints under /mutual-funds/... vs /equities/... to clearly separate concerns.

Scalability for multi-asset will also mean re-architecting certain components: an APIs gateway will become even more useful to route to different microservices handling each asset domain. We’d introduce a service registry and possibly an event bus to handle cross-domain events (e.g., a generic notification service that alerts users of any transaction across assets). Our caching layer might need segmentation by asset class to manage different data volatility.

When we extend to new assets, we will follow the same best practices as for mutual funds:

*   For Equities: integrate with a broker or exchange API for trading, real-time quotes via websockets perhaps.

*   For NPS or bonds: connect with their respective systems (maybe through NSDL APIs for NPS).

*   The app’s UI is already structured (from what we see in the screenshots) to accommodate multiple asset sections (Mutual Funds, NPS, P2P, etc.), so the navigation will simply enable those when available.


Scaling Team & Process: As the product grows, the development team can also be divided per asset module or feature. Our codebase structure and CI pipeline will accommodate multiple teams working in parallel, with code owners for each module. We will continue to enhance automated tests for each new feature to maintain quality as scope broadens.
